        <p><em>Hey guys! Just wanted to send you both a message to thank you for having us last night, and also commend you on an incredible job hosting the event! When George asked me to participate, I was excited and eager, but wasn't really sure what you guys were all about. I can say with confidence after last night that you guys are one of the best, most organized clubs that I've come across on this campus and one that ACTUALLY benefits our student body, rather than just jointing together to support a cause. I think that an event like last nights' is/was exactly what the mental health community as a whole, as well as our student body, needed, and after speaking with some of the people in attendance afterwards, I truly think it was appreciated and valued by everyone who was in that room. I was moved and inspired last night listening to some of the stories, which, as I highlighted at the end of the night, is HUGE when you're talking about a topic that's normally sensitive and labelled "negative". I would LOVE to work with you guys more in the future and am absolutely sure George would be on board. We will stay in touch for sure; best of luck in the coming weeks with everything school and club related for the both of you! Cheers, Dylan

        <p><em>Keith and the Golden Speakers Club was an excellent edition to our “Next Generation of Lawyer’s Social”. He was able to engage with our members and provide them with an excellent account of how to get the most from our upcoming networking events. Keith along with his group provided the Laurier Law Society with ice breaking exercises that allowed each one of our members to get comfortable networking. I would definitely recommend the Golden Speaker’s Club to anyone looking to improve on any aspect of personal, or professional life! Thanks again guys!

        <p><em>Golden Speakers not only solidified our future brand, but helped us rediscover our identity as an organization. Starting from the beginning, focusing on our purpose, and guiding us towards a more meaningful image allowed us to pivot into a newer and better club. Golden Speakers' incredible story-focused approach to branding is something that we haven't faced before, but it is by far the most effective. Definitely, a high recommendation.

        <p><em>We were fortunate enough to have the Golden Speakers come run a public speaking workshop during our club’s training session this September. Not only did they provide very relevant training, but they also tailored their presentation to our needs and made it specific to our club. We were very impressed by their level of professionalism and the energy they brought to the discussion. We loved that the Golden Speakers were able to engage our volunteers by incorporating interactive and fun activities throughout the session. We received very positive feedback from our executives and would be happy to have them back for additional training. Overall, the Golden Speakers were an amazing group to work with and we would highly recommend them for your next club training or event!

I look forward to seeing this group continue to share the power of speech.

In only a couple hours, I learned valuable speech structuring techniques and strategies that I will use for the rest of my life - Katie also put me through an awesome practical, which gave me the opportunity to apply this new information, to practice the 'soft' & 'technical' skills of speech delivery, and to take a step in the right direction in overcoming my fear/uncertainty of speaking with a mic in my hand. Overall, this was an incredibly valuable experience and I recommend Katie and GSC to anyone who wants to improve their public speaking skills and abilities.</em>
